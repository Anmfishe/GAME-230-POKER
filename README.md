# GAME-230-POKER
Third project for GAME 230



Going for all objectives and the bonus objectives of:

Sort player's hand

Player's hand is a linked list

CREATE YOUR OWN: Linked list class is templated

Other notes:

Swapping a card discards the original card instead of putting it back into the deck as how we discussed

I haven't had memory leaks on my last 10 runs, it should be clean

I made it so the player could enter unsorted letters, not sure if that was required

Pretty tough, haven't had to overload operators in a long time. 7.5/10 difficulty

It should be noted on the syllabus that the memory leaks function should be called AFTER all destructors have been run.
I thought I had an error for a long time thinking that the function would run after my destructors, not before
